The provided Python code has a few issues that prevent it from extracting the questions and their choices properly:

1. The `choice_elements` are not being extracted correctly because the `<input>` elements are not direct children of the
   `<p>` element containing the question text.
2. The logic to extract the text for each choice assumes that there's always a `<br>` tag following each `<input>` element,
   which may not always be true.
3. The `find_next_sibling()` method is not used correctly to extract the text for each choice.

To fix these issues, we'll need to adjust the code to better navigate the HTML structure and extract the questions and
choices accurately. Here's a corrected version of the Python code using BeautifulSoup:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Read HTML content from the file
with open("html_element.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    html_content = file.read()

# Parse HTML using BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, "html.parser")

# Find all <p> elements containing questions
question_paragraphs = soup.find_all("p")

# Extract and print the text content and choices of each question
for index, paragraph in enumerate(question_paragraphs):
    if paragraph.find("span", class_="blue"):  # Check if the paragraph contains a question
        question_text = paragraph.find("span", class_="blue").get_text(strip=True).split("-", 1)[-1].strip()
        print(f"Question {index + 1}: {question_text}
")
        input_elements = paragraph.find_all("input", type="radio")

        # Extract the text for each choice
        for input_element in input_elements:
            # The text for each choice is the sibling of the input element
            choice_text = input_element.next_sibling.strip()
            print(f"{input_element['value']}. {choice_text}")
        print("
")
```

This code will print each question and its associated choices based on the structure of the provided HTML. The questions
are identified by looking for `<p>` elements that contain a `<span>` with the class `blue`. The choices for each question
are extracted by finding the sibling text nodes of the `<input>` elements with the type `radio`
